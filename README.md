# 🐾 Virtual Pet AI Companion — by S7

This is a **personal interactive AI pet project** that blends frame-by-frame **pixel animation**, emotional state logic, and a floating web companion. It began as a creative experiment — what if an AI pet didn’t just respond, but remembered?

All animations were drawn by me, pixel by pixel, and the system’s logic was written and trained in Python. The pet floats quietly on your screen, waiting for you to come home.

## Features

- 🐱 Floating pixel cat that blinks and follows you
- 💬 Soft greeting: _“Welcome home. Long day, I missed you.”_
- 🎮 Demo video of pet behaviors
- 🧠 Memory viewer shows how the pet “remembers” you — affection, hunger, energy, etc.
- 🎨 All visuals handcrafted with Procreate, frame by frame

## Pixel Art & Emotion

Every animation (like the blinking cat) is hand-drawn in **4-frame loops**, exported in consistent pixel resolution for clarity. The goal isn’t realism, but **emotional presence** — something soft, warm, and quietly alive.

## Why I Made This

I’ve always loved combining **code with feeling**. This pet isn’t just a simulation — it reacts, remembers, and reflects how you treat it.

Instead of only timers or scoring, I designed a model where every action leaves a trace. Feed it gently, or scold it — and it will remember.
